	"readme": "# @stylable/webpack-plugin\n\n[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@stylable/webpack-plugin.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stylable/webpack-plugin)\n\n`@stylable/webpack-plugin` (for webpack `v4.x`) is the main build utility for [Stylable](https://stylable.io/). It supports both development and production modes, providing various configurations that can be tweaked according to your specific needs. It enables loading Stylable files (`.st.css`) from local projects or imported from a 3rd party source (for example, NPM node modules).\n\n## Getting started\nInstall `@stylable/webpack-plugin` as a dev dependency in your local project.\n\nInstall using npm:\n```bash\nnpm install @stylable/webpack-plugin --save-dev\n```\n\nInstall using yarn:\n```bash\nyarn add @stylable/webpack-plugin --dev\n```\n\n Sample dev config:\n```js\n// webpack.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  …\n  plugins: [new StylableWebpackPlugin()]\n  …\n};\n```\n## Plugin Configuration Options\nSome of the default values given to configuration parameters depend on what environment mode is currently active in webpack (`development` or `production`).\nBelow you can see the various possible configuration parameters and their default values.\n\n| Option\t| Type\t| Development Mode Default | Production Mode Default | Description |\n|---------|:-----:|:-----------------:|:----------------:|------------|\n|outputCSS | boolean |\tfalse\t| true | Generate CSS asset files per bundle |\n|filename\t| string | -\t| [name].bundle.css | The name of the CSS bundle file when outputCSS is enabled |\n|includeCSSInJS |\tboolean\t| true | false | Include target CSS in the JavaScript modules (used by runtime renderer) |\n| createRuntimeChunk | boolean | false | false | Move **all** Stylable modules into a separate chunk with a runtime renderer |\n| bootstrap.autoInit | boolean | true | true | Initialize the rendering of the CSS in the browser |\n| optimize.removeUnusedComponents | boolean | true | true | Remove selectors that contain namespaces (classes) that are not imported by JavaScript |\n| optimize.removeComments | boolean | false | true | Remove CSS comments from the target |\n| optimize.removeStylableDirectives | boolean | true | true | Remove all `-st-*` from target (currently also removes empty rules which will be a separate option coming soon) |\n| optimize.classNameOptimizations | boolean | false | true | Shorten all class names and replace them in the JavaScript modules |\n| optimize.shortNamespaces | boolean | false | true | Shorten all namespaces which affects the resulting `data-*` selectors and DOM attributes |\n| optimize.minify | boolean | false | true | Minify each css asset. |\n\n### Sample production configuration\n```js\nnew StylableWebpackPlugin({ \n    outputCSS: true, \n    includeCSSInJS: false,\n    optimize: {\n      removeUnusedComponents: true,\n      removeComments: true,\n      removeStylableDirectives: true,\n      classNameOptimizations: true,\n      shortNamespaces: true,\n      minify: true\n    }\n})\n```\n## Asset handling\nCSS assets are handled by a url-loader + file-loader combination.\n```js\n module: {\n    rules: [\n      {\n        test: /\\.(png|jpg|gif)$/,\n        use: [\n          {\n            loader: \"url-loader\",\n            options: {\n              limit: 8192\n            }\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n```\n## Compatibilities with existing loading mechanisms\nIf you're using css_loader/extract make sure to exclude `.st.css` files from the process. You cannot use loaders with Stylable `.st.css` files\n\n## How it works\nThe plugin transforms all Stylable files into JavaScript modules with CSS rendering capabilities. \n\nEvery bundle that contains Stylable modules is injected with a `stylable-bootstrap-module` as its entrypoint. This module is responsible for: \n* Ensuring that all of the transformed modules are imported in the proper order. \n* Initializing the runtime DOM renderer. \n\nThe resulting renderer orders the CSS by the depth of each module, calculated from its dependencies and component dependencies. \n\n**Stylable bootstrap module** The `stylable-bootstrap-module` is a generated module injected into the bundle as its entrypoint and ensures all Stylable modules are injected into the runtime renderer.\n\n**Runtime DOM renderer** The core Stylable runtime renderer in the browser is responsible for rendering stylesheets in the correct order in the DOM.\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (c) 2017 Wix.com Ltd.
